 * Use backslashes to assign a string to the myStr variable so that if you were to print it to the console, you would see:
 * I am a "double quoted" string inside "double quotes".
 * You should use two double quotes (") and four escaped double quotes (\").
 * Variable myStr should contain the string: I am a "double quoted" string inside "double quotes".
