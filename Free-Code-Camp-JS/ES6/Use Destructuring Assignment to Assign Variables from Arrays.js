/*
Intructions

Use destructuring assignment to swap the values of a and b so that a receives the value stored in b, and b receives the value stored in a.

Value of a should be 6, after swapping.
Value of b should be 8, after swapping.
You should use array destructuring to swap a and b.
*/

let a = 8, b = 6;
[a, b] = [b, a];
